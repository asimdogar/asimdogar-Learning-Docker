First Alpine Linux Containers
Open Lab : https://labs.play-with-docker.com/#
1.0 Running your first container

$ docker container run hello-world

1.1 Docker Images
Alpine is a lightweight Linux distribution so it is quick to pull down and run, making it a popular starting point for many other images.

$ docker image pull alpine
$ docker image ls

1.1 Docker Container Run

$ docker container run alpine ls -l

$ docker container run alpine echo "hello from alpine"

$ docker container ls
$ docker container ls -a

1.2 Container Isolation

$ docker container run -it alpine /bin/ash

echo "hello world" > hello.txt

 ls

$ docker container run alpine ls


$ docker container start <container ID>

$ docker container exec <container ID> ls

1.3 Terminology


    Images - The file system and configuration of our application which are used to create containers.
    Containers - Running instances of Docker images — containers run the actual applications.

    Docker daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers.
    Docker client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the Docker daemon.
    Docker Store - Store is, among other things, a registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. You’ll be using this later in this tutorial.
